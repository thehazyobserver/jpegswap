1. Fee Collection and Distribution
Do we store the stakers’ rewards as a balance per user in the pool, or stream them out incrementally per interaction?

Recommendation: track claimable balances and let users claim() to save gas.

STONER pool share: should the fees be sent directly on each swap, or pooled and claimed later?

Recommendation: track total claimable across all pools, claimable by $STONER holders.

2. NFT Metadata / Trait Filtering
Should we allow users to filter what traits they want to avoid or keep when rerolling (e.g., avoid commons)?

If not, we’ll keep it pure random for now — but this could be added later.

3. Staker Reward Calculation
Is the staker reward split:

Equal per staked NFT, or

Proportional by time staked, or

Weighted by rarity (future feature)?

Recommendation: equal per NFT for simplicity.

4. Unstaking Mechanism
If a staker’s NFT has been swapped, they no longer have a claim — correct?

If yes, unstake just fails unless they already have a replacement in the pool.

5. Reentrancy & Abuse Protections
For swap logic: if someone front-runs or triggers rapid swaps, do you want to rate-limit swaps (e.g., max 1 per tx or cooldown)?

Might not be needed now, but a good guardrail.

6. Dev Wallets & Ownership Controls
Do you want a dev wallet:

To receive a portion of the swap fee?

Or just retain ownership for future upgrades?

Should pools be upgradeable (via proxy) or keep it simple with fixed logic?

7. Frontend Considerations
Will the DApp allow:

Users to view the pool contents before swapping?

Users to see their staked NFTs and pending rewards?

Sorting by rarity/traits eventually?
