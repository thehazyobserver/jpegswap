# 🎨 JPEGSwap: How the NFT Swapping DApp Works

## 🌟 Overview

JPEGSwap is a sophisticated NFT swapping and staking ecosystem that allows users to:
- **Swap NFTs** from the same collection with small fees
- **Stake NFTs** to earn rewards from swap fees
- **Earn passive income** through multiple reward streams
- **Access advanced analytics** with real-time insights

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Four Pillars

### 1. 🎫 **StakeReceipt.sol** - The Receipt System
**What it does:** Issues non-transferable receipt NFTs when you stake your valuable NFTs.

```
Your NFT → Stake → Get Receipt Token
Receipt Token → Unstake → Get NFT Back
```

**Key Features:**
- **Non-transferable by design** - Prevents receipt trading exploits
- **Timestamp tracking** - Records when receipts were created
- **1:1 mapping** - Each receipt corresponds to one original NFT
- **Historical analytics** - Tracks your complete staking timeline

---

### 2. 🔄 **SwapPool.sol** - The Core Engine
**What it does:** The main contract where all the magic happens - swapping and staking with rewards.

#### **Two Ways to Use:**

##### 🔄 **NFT Swapping**
```
1. You have: Bored Ape #123
2. Pool has: Bored Ape #456, #789, #101
3. You pay swap fee (e.g., 0.01 ETH)
4. You get: Random Bored Ape from pool
5. Your #123 joins the pool
```

##### 💰 **NFT Staking for Rewards**
```
1. Stake your NFT → Get receipt token
2. Your NFT earns from ALL swap fees
3. Unstake anytime → Get rewards + NFT back
4. NFT might be different (if others swapped)
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Health scoring** (0-100) for pool risk assessment
- **Smart recommendations** based on your activity
- **Real-time analytics** dashboard
- **Batch operations** for gas efficiency

---

### 3. 💎 **StonerFeePool.sol** - The Premium Rewards Pool
**What it does:** A separate high-yield staking pool for premium NFT holders.

```
Special NFT Collection → Stake → Earn Higher Rewards
```

**Why it exists:**
- **Higher reward rates** for premium collections
- **Fee sharing** from main swap pools
- **Exclusive access** for specific NFT holders
- **Real timestamp analytics** for accurate reward calculations

---

### 4. 🏭 **SwapPoolFactory.sol** - The Pool Creator
**What it does:** Creates and manages multiple swap pools for different NFT collections.

```
New Collection → Factory Creates Pool → Users Can Swap/Stake
```

**Factory Powers:**
- **Multi-pool management** across different NFT collections
- **Cross-pool analytics** and health monitoring
- **Batch reward claiming** from multiple pools
- **Global optimization** recommendations

## 💰 The Economics: Where Money Flows

### **Revenue Streams for Stakers:**

```
Swap Fee (0.01 ETH) is Split:
├── 80% → Regular Stakers (SwapPool)
└── 20% → Premium Stakers (StonerFeePool)
```

### **Example Earnings:**
```
100 swaps per day × 0.01 ETH = 1 ETH daily revenue
├── 0.8 ETH → Split among SwapPool stakers
└── 0.2 ETH → Split among StonerFeePool stakers

If you stake 1 NFT out of 100 total staked:
Daily reward = 0.8 ETH ÷ 100 = 0.008 ETH (~$20)
Monthly reward = 0.008 × 30 = 0.24 ETH (~$600)
```
