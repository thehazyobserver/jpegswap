## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy StakeReceipt Contract (First)
```solidity
constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_)
```
**Example:**
```
Name: "JPEGSwap Stake Receipt"
Symbol: "JSR"
```

### 2. Deploy SwapPool Implementation (Second)
```solidity
// Deploy the implementation contract (not proxy)
// This will be used by the factory to create pools
```

### 3. Deploy StonerFeePool Implementation (Third)
```solidity
// Deploy the implementation contract
// This will be used as the fee collection pool
```

### 4. Deploy SwapPoolFactory (Fourth)
```solidity
constructor(address _implementation)
```
**Parameters:**
- `_implementation`: Address of the deployed SwapPool implementation

### 5. Initialize Contracts

#### A. Set Pool Address in StakeReceipt
```solidity
stakeReceipt.setPool(swapPoolAddress)
```

#### B. Create Swap Pool via Factory
```solidity
factory.createPool(
    nftCollection,     // NFT collection address
    receiptContract,   // StakeReceipt contract address
    stonerPool,        // StonerFeePool address
    swapFeeInWei,      // Fee amount (e.g., 0.01 ETH = 10000000000000000)
    stonerShare        // Percentage to stoner pool (0-100)
)
```

#### C. Initialize StonerFeePool
```solidity
stonerFeePool.initialize(
    stonerNFTAddress,  // Address of NFT collection for stoner pool
    receiptContract    // StakeReceipt contract address
)
```

## 🔧 Configuration Parameters

### Recommended Settings

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `swapFeeInWei` | 10000000000000000 (0.01 ETH) | Swap fee amount |
| `stonerShare` | 20 | 20% of fees go to stoner pool |
| `maxBatchSize` | 10-25 | Configurable batch operation limit |
| `maxUnstakeAllLimit` | 20-50 | Maximum tokens for unstake all |

### 🆕 Enhanced Precision Features (Solidity ^0.8.19)
- **PRECISION Constant**: 1e27 for high-precision reward calculations
- **Remainder Tracking**: Minimizes rounding errors in reward distribution
- **Enhanced Math**: Improved accuracy for small reward amounts

### 🆕 Gas Estimation Functions
```solidity
// Dynamic gas estimation for optimal user experience
estimateBatchUnstakeGas(user, batchSize) → gasEstimate
estimateBatchStakeGas(tokenIds[]) → gasEstimate  
estimateBatchClaimGas(user, batchSize) → gasEstimate
estimateUnstakeAllGas(user) → gasEstimate

// Factory-level gas estimation
estimateBatchGasCosts(batchSize) → totalGasEstimate
```

### 🆕 Configurable Batch Limits
```solidity
// Admin function for runtime configuration
setBatchLimits(newMaxBatchSize, newMaxUnstakeAll)

// Recommended Production Values:
// maxBatchSize: 25 (increased from default 10)
// maxUnstakeAllLimit: 50 (increased from default 20)
```

### Gas Limit Recommendations
- Single swap: ~200,000 gas
- Single stake/unstake: ~150,000 gas
- Batch operations: 21,000 + (150,000 × num_items)
- Factory batch claims: Depends on number of pools
- **🆕 Gas estimation available**: Use estimation functions for accurate predictions

## 🎯 Usage Flow

### For Users:
1. **Swap NFTs**: Pay fee → Get different NFT from pool
2. **Stake NFTs**: Lock NFT → Get receipt token → Earn rewards from swap fees
3. **Unstake NFTs**: Burn receipt → Get original NFT back (or random if swapped) + auto-claim rewards
4. **Claim Rewards**: Get ETH rewards from accumulated swap fees

### For Admins:
1. **Create Pools**: Use factory to create pools for new NFT collections
2. **Manage Fees**: Adjust swap fees and stoner share percentages
3. **Emergency Functions**: Pause, emergency withdrawals, etc.
4. **Monitor**: Track pool statistics and user activity

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Multi-Signature Recommendations
- Use multi-sig wallet for factory owner
- Use multi-sig for individual pool owners
- Consider timelock for critical parameter changes

### Monitoring
- Monitor large batch operations for gas usage
- Watch for unusual reward claim patterns
- Track pool token balances vs. staked amounts

### Emergency Procedures
- All contracts have pause functionality
- Emergency withdrawal functions for admins
- Receipt validation prevents cross-pool exploits
